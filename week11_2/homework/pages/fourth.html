			<h3>Bane's Speech to The People [Normal Box]</h3>
			<p>"We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with myths of opportunity, and we give it back to you... the people. Gotham is yours. None shall interfere. Do as you please. Start by storming Blackgate, and freeing the oppressed! Step forward those who would serve. For and army will be raised. The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests, and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure. Courts will be convened. Spoils will be enjoyed. Blood will be shed. The police will survive, as they learn to serve true justice. This great city... it will endure. Gotham will survive!" - Bane, The Dark Knight Rises</p>

			<h3>Craziness Is Relative</h3>
			<p>“Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just... *do* things.” - The Joker, The Dark Knight</p>

			<br/>
			The power that's inside

			I know it's my destiny

			Pokémon! Oh, you're my best friend

			In a world we must defend
			<br/>
			Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all
			<br/>
			A heart so true
			<br/>
			Our courage will pull us through

			You teach me, and I'll teach you

			<p>"We both want the same thing. We both want the peace Jiraiya spoke of. You and I are no different. We’re both working for our own justice. The justice I have meted out against Konoha, is exactly the same as what you’re trying to mete out against me. Everyone feels the pain of loss the same. We both know that pain. You are working for your justice, and I for mine. We are just ordinary people driven to revenge in the name of justice. But if revenge is called justice, then that justice breeds yet more revenge. And becomes a chain of hatred. Living within it, aware of the past, predicting the future. That is what it means to know history. We cannot help but know that people cannot understand each other. The world of ninjas is ruled by hatred." -- Pain of The Akatsuki, Naruto Shippuden</p>
